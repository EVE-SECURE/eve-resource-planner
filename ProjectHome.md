Choose what tier resource you want to create. One this is done a second drop down menu will appear in this menu choose the name of the resource you want to create. After this is selected you will get another drop down menu. Here you will choose if you want to enter the quantity of how many to make or calculate how many you can make for a specific cargo hold size. After these things are entered just click the calculate button and the bottom will fill up with a table of all the resources from each tier you will need and how many of each are required to create your final product. At the moment Tier one and two will filter which resources you can choose based on the Planets that you have selected at the top.

NOTE: I am currently in the process of rebuilding this tool from scratch, as V2 (also can be seen on my github.), in my free time. This is going to take some time seeing as how I am also rebuilding the database from scratch as well. (Plus I have a job now) Any features you would like to see or any comments on the tool please don't hesitate to let me know.
