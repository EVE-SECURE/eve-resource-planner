<h2>Description</h2>
Application to help EVE Online users plan their planetary resource systems.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Choose what tier resource you want to create. One this is done a second drop down menu will appear in this menu choose the name of the resource you want to create. After this is selected you will get another drop down menu. Here you will choose if you want to enter the quantity of how many to make or calculate how many you can make for a specific cargo hold size. After these things are entered just click the calculate button and the bottom will fill up with a table of all the resources from each tier you will need and how many of each are required to create your final product.

<h2>Warning</h2>
Only tiers 1, 2, and 3 are actually working at the moment. Tier 4 is proving to be a bit difficult to create a system for.
