<h2>Description</h2>
Application to help EVE Online users plan their PI systems.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Choose what tier resource you want to create. One this is done a second drop down menu will appear in this menu choose the name of the resource you want to create. After this is selected you will get another drop down menu. Here you will choose if you want to enter the quantity of how many to make or calculate how many you can make for a specific cargo hold size. After these things are entered just click the calculate button and the bottom will fill up with a table of all the resources from each tier you will need and how many of each are required to create your final product. At the moment Tier one and two will filter which resources you can choose based on the Planets that you have selected at the top. 

<h2>Warning</h2>
At the moment there are only 2 resources that don't work. They are the two P4 Resources that require 3 P2 resources for each P3 item.

<h2>Future</h2>
In the future I plan on adding the planet selection filter to all tiers of resources. I also want to add in an export tool to allow users to export all the resources needed for the specific final product that they set up into a single text document. I am well aware that not everyone has a 17 inch monitor like I do on my laptop so I plan to also add the ability to resize the window for use on smaller screens.
